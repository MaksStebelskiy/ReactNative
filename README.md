# ReactNative

This is a project of a mobile application for a utility cost manager using React Native + Expo.

For now, this app works locally, meaning that the database is created on the device and does not connect to a remote server to retrieve data. The user can view expenses for a specific period, and can add, edit and delete existing utility cost records.
